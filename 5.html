  <h2>Treatment</h2>
  <p>Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease, for which there is no known cure except in very specific situations.[77] Management concentrates on keeping blood sugar levels as close to normal, without causing low blood sugar. This can usually be accomplished with a healthy diet, exercise, weight loss, and use of appropriate medications (insulin in the case of type 1 diabetes; oral medications, as well as possibly insulin, in type 2 diabetes).</p>
